# Genome Assembly Playground

A simple demonstration of genome assembly using a Eulerian de Bruijn graph, with interactive animations powered by D3.js.

Individual 'reads' can be entered, and k-mer size can be selected. The resultant Eulerian de Bruijn graph is shown, and can be used to highlight the effect of k-mer size on the overall graph structure.

This can be run locally using any simple web server (e.g. Live Server within VSCode, or `python3 -m http.server`).

It is also available on Github Pages - https://andrewguy.github.io/genome_assembly_playground
